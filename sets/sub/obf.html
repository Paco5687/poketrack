    <h1>Obsidian Flames</h1>
    <p><strong>Raging Flames Forged in Darkness!</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Red-hot embers illuminate the pitch-black night and sparks flare 
    <br>into an inferno as Charizard ex surges forth with newfound powers of 
    <br>darkness! The glittering Terastal phenomenon imbues some Pokémon ex 
    <br>like Tyranitar, Eiscue, and Vespiquen with different types than usual, 
    <br>while Dragonite ex and Greedent ex show mastery of their own inner 
    <br>strengths. Not to be outdone, Revavroom ex, Melmetal ex, and more Pokémon 
    <br>promise to change the course of battle in the Scarlet & Violet—Obsidian 
    <br>Flames expansion!
